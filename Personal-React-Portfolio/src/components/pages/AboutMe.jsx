      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div>DOB: 07/09/1996</div>
        <div>Currently living in Columbus, OH</div>
        <p>I started my path to web development after completing my certificate program from EdX @ OSU School for Engineering for Full Stack Web Development on 2/15/24. Here I've learned all the basic tools necessary for me to expand my knowledge in the field of front end and back end web development. Since joining I have completed many different projects that you may find in the projects tab on the navbar. These display my knowledge for configuring webpages from scratch as well as developing code to be adapted with the everchanging coding language.
